## PyRobot - A Python Robot Library

Really, it's just some scripts for understanding my EV3 with [ev3dev](https://www.ev3dev.org).

## Python API
See the docs for the ev3 python API [here](https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev-lang-python). Sadly, the best way to see what is available in the API is to just read the source.
